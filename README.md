Description
-----------
Tube2FEM is a general-purpose highly-automated pipeline for flow related processes in (embedded) tubular objects. 
Addressing a critical gap in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and simulation sciences, it facilitates the transition from raw three-dimensional imaging, graph networks, or Computer Aided Design (CAD) models of tubular objects to refined, simulation-ready meshes.
The pipeline leverages a range of open-source software and libraries, notably [GIBBON](https://www.gibboncode.org), [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/), and [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/), to provide
flexibility and broad applicability across different simulation scenarios, ranging from biomedical to industrial
applications.
